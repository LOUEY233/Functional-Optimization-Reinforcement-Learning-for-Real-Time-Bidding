# Real-Time Bidding Using Functional Optimization Reinforcement Learning
 This is the research project of optimal real-time bidding in computational advertising field. 

**Abstract**

Real-time bidding is the new paradigm of programmatic advertising. An advertiser wants to make the intelligent choice of utilizing a Demand-Side Platform to improve
the performance of their ad campaigns. Existing approaches
are struggling to provide a satisfactory solution for bidding
optimization due to stochastic bidding behavior. In this paper,
we proposed a multi-agent reinforcement learning architecture
for RTB with functional optimization. We designed four agents
bidding environment: three Lagrange-multiplier based functional
optimization agents and one baseline agent (without any atttribute of functional optimization) First, numerous attributes
have been assigned to each agent, including biased or unbiased
win probability, Lagrange multiplier, and click-through rate. In
order to evaluate the proposed RTB strategy’s performance,
we demonstrate the results on ten sequential simulated auction campaigns. The results show that agents with functional
actions and rewards had the most significant average winning
rate and winning surplus, given biased and unbiased winning
information respectively. The experimental evaluations show that
our approach significantly improve the campaign’s efficacy and
profitability.
